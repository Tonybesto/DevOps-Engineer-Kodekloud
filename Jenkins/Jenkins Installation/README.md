The DevOps team of xFusionCorp Industries is planning to setup some CI/CD pipelines. After several meetings they have decided to use Jenkins server. So, we need to setup a Jenkins Server as soon as possible. Please complete the task as per requirements mentioned below:



1. Install `jenkins` on jenkins server using `yum` utility only, and start its `service`. You might face timeout issue while starting the Jenkins service, please refer this link for help.


2. Jenkin's admin user name should be `theadmin`, password should be `Adm!n321`, full name should be `Ammar` and email should be `ammar@jenkins.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`.


Note:


1. For this task, ssh into the `jenkins` server using user `root` and password `S3curePass` from `jump host`.


2. After installing the Jenkins server, please click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access Jenkins UI and follow the on-screen instructions to create an admin user.
