#### Create Pods in Kubernetes Cluster
The Nautilus DevOps team has started practicing some pods and services deployment on Kubernetes platform as they are planning to migrate most of their applications on Kubernetes platform. Recently one of the team members has been assigned a task to create a pod as per details mentioned below:



Create a pod named `pod-httpd` using `httpd` image with `latest` tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e `httpd:latest`.

Labels `app` should be set to `httpd_app`, also container should be named as `httpd-container`.

`Note`: The `kubectl` utility on `jump_host` has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
