**The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to set up a Nagios monitoring tool to monitor some applications, services etc. They are planning to deploy it on Kubernetes cluster. Below you can find more details.**




1) Create a deployment `nagios-deployment` for Nagios core. The container name must be `nagios-container` and it must use `jasonrivers/nagios` image.

2) Create a user and password for the Nagios core web interface, user must be `xFusionCorp` and password must be `LQfKeWWxWD`. (you can manually perform this step after deployment)

3) Create a service `nagios-service` for Nagios, which must be of `targetPort` type. `nodePort` must be `30008`.

You can use any labels as per your choice.
