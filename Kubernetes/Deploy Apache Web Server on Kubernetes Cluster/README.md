#### Deploy Apache Web Server on Kubernetes Cluster

There is an application that needs to be deployed on Kubernetes cluster under Apache web server. The Nautilus application development team has asked the DevOps team to deploy it. We need to develop a template as per requirements mentioned below:

Create a `namespace` named as `httpd-namespace-datacenter`.

Create a service named as `httpd-service-datacenter` under same namespace, `targetPort` should be 80 and `nodePort` should be `30004`.

Create a `deployment` named as `httpd-deployment-datacenter` under the same namespace as mentioned above. Use image `httpd` with `latest` tag only and remember to mention tag i.e httpd:latest, and container name should be httpd-container-datacenter. And make sure replicas counts are 2.

Set labels app to `httpd_app_datacenter`.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
