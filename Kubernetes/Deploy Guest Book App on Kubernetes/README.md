BACK-END TIER

Create a deployment named `redis-master` for Redis master.

a.) Replicas count should be 1.

b.) Container name should be `master-redis-devops` and it should use image redis.

c.) Request resources as `CPU` should be `100m` and Memory should be `100Mi`.

d.) Container port should be redis default port i.e `6379`.


Create a service named `redis-master` for Redis master. Port and targetPort should be Redis default port i.e `6379`.


Create an another deployment named `redis-slave` for Redis slave.

a.) Replicas count should be `2`.

b.) Container name should be `slave-redis-devops` and it should use `gcr.io/google_samples/gb-redisslave:v3` image.

c.) Requests resources as `CPU` should be `100m` and Memory should be `100Mi`.

d.) Define an environment variable named `GET_HOSTS_FROM` and its value should be `dns`.

e.) Container port should be Redis default port i.e `6379`.


Create an another service named `redis-slave`. It should use Redis default port i.e `6379`.

**`FRONT END TIER`**

Create a deployment named `frontend`.

a.) Replicas count should be `3`.

b.) Container name should be `php-redis-devops` and it should use `gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend:v4` image.

c.) Request resources as `CPU` should be `100m` and Memory should be `100Mi`.

d.) Define an environment variable named as `GET_HOSTS_FROM` and its value should be dns.

e.) Container port should be `80`.


Create a service named `frontend`. Its `type` should be `NodePort`, port should be `80` and its `nodePort` should be `30009`.

Finally you can check `guestbook app` by clicking on `+` button on top left corner and `Select port to view on Host 1` then enter your `nodePort`.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
