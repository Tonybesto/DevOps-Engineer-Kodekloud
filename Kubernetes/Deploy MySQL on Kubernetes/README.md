#### Deploy MySQL to Kubernetes

A new MySQL server needs to be deployed on Kubernetes cluster. The Nautilus DevOps team was working on to gather the requirements. Recently they were able to finalize the requirements and shared them with the team members to start working on it. Below you can find the details:

1.) Create a PersistentVolume `mysql-pv`, its capacity should be `250Mi`, set other parameters as per your preference.

2.) Create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` to request this PersistentVolume storage. Name it as `mysql-pv-claim` and request a 250Mi of storage. Set other parameters as per your preference.

3.) Create a deployment named `mysql-deployment`, use any `mysql` image as per your preference. Mount the PersistentVolume at mount path `/var/lib/mysql`.

4.) Create a NodePort type service named `mysql` and set nodePort to `30007`.

5.) Create a secret named `mysql-root-pass` having a key pair value, where key is password and its value is `YUIidhb667`, create another secret named mysql-user-pass having some key pair values, where frist key is username and its value is kodekloud_tim, second key is password and value is LQfKeWWxWD, create one more secret named mysql-db-url, key name is database and value is kodekloud_db6

6.) Define some Environment variables within the container:

a) name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, should pick value from secretKeyRef name: mysql-root-pass and key: password

b) name: MYSQL_DATABASE, should pick value from secretKeyRef name: mysql-db-url and key: database

c) name: MYSQL_USER, should pick value from secretKeyRef name: mysql-user-pass key key: username

d) name: MYSQL_PASSWORD, should pick value from secretKeyRef name: mysql-user-pass and key: password

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
