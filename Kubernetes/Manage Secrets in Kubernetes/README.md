#### Manage Secrets in Kubernetes

The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to deploy some tools in Kubernetes cluster. Some of the tools are licence based so that licence information needs to be stored securely within Kubernetes cluster. So team want to utilize Kubernetes secrets to store those secrets. Below you can find more details about the requirements:


    Also create a pod named as secret-nautilus.

    Configure pod's spec as container name should be secret-container-nautilus, image should be ubuntu preferably with latest tag (remember to mention the tag with image). Use command '/bin/bash', '-c' and 'sleep 10000' for container. Mount a volume named as secret-volume-nautilus. The mount path should be /opt/games and mode should be readOnly.

    Mount the secret within this volume.

    To verify you can exec into the container secret-container-nautilus, to check the secret key under the mounted path /opt/games.

    Secret type should be generic.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
