#### Create Namespaces in Kubernetes Cluster

The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to deploy some micro services on Kubernetes platform. The team has already set up a Kubernetes cluster and now they want set up some namespaces, deployments etc. Based on the current requirements the team has shared the details below:

Create a namespace named `dev` and create a POD under it; name the pod `dev-nginx-pod` and use `nginx` image with `latest tag` only and remember to mention tag i.e `nginx:latest`.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
