#### ReplicationController in Kubernetes

The Nautilus DevOps team wants to create a ReplicationController to deploy several pods. They are going to deploy applications on these pods, which need some highly available infrastructure. Below you can find exact details, and please create the ReplicationController accordingly.


Create a ReplicationController using `nginx` image, preferably with `latest` tag, and name it as `nginx-replicationcontroller`.

Labels `app` should be `nginx_app`, and labels type should be `front-end`. The container should be named as `nginx-container` and also make sure `replica` counts are `3`.

All pods should be running state.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
