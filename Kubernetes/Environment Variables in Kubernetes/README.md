#### Environment Variables in Kubernetes

There are number of parameters that are used by applications which we need to define as environment variables so that we can use them as per our need within different configs. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. Please find below more details about he same.

Create a `namespace` named as `fieldref-namespace`.

Create a `pod` named `envars-fieldref` under the namespace `fieldref-namespace`.

Configure spec as the `container name` should be `fieldref-container`, use image `nginx` preferable `latest` tag, use command `'sh', '-c' and args` should be

`'while true; do echo -en '/n'; printenv NODE_NAME POD_NAME POD_NAMESPACE; printenv POD_IP POD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT; sleep 10; done;'`

(Note: please take care of indentations)

Define five environment variables as mentioned below:

a.) First env should be named as `NODE_NAME`, set valueFrom `fieldref` and fieldPath should be `spec.nodeName`.

b.) Second env should named as `POD_NAME`, set valueFrom `fieldref `and fieldPath should be` metadata.name`.

c.) Third env should named as `POD_NAMESPACE`, set valueFrom `fieldref` and fieldPath should be `metadata.namespace`.

d.) Forth env should named as `POD_IP`, set valueFrom `fieldref` and fieldPath should be `status.podIP`.

e.) Fifth env should named as `POD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, set valueFrom `fieldref` and fieldPath shoulbe be `spec.serviceAccountName`.

Set restart policy to` Never`.

To check the output, exec the pod and use printenv command.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
