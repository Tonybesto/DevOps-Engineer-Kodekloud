#### Deploy Nginx and Phpfpm on Kubernetes

The Nautilus Application Development team is planning to deploy one of the php-based application on Kubernetes cluster. As per discussion with DevOps team they have decided to use nginx and phpfpm. Additionally, they shared some custom configuration requirements. Below you can find more details. Please complete the task as per requirements mentioned below:



1) Create a service to expose this app, the service type must be NodePort, nodePort should be 30012.

2.) Create a `config map` `nginx-config` for `nginx.conf` as we want to add some custom settings for nginx.conf.

a) Change default port `80` to `8094` in nginx.conf.

b) Change default document root `/usr/share/nginx` to `/var/www/html` in nginx.conf.

c) Update directory index to index index.html index.htm index.php in nginx.conf.

3.) Create a pod named `nginx-phpfpm` .

b) Create a shared volume `shared-files` that will be used by both containers (nginx and phpfpm) also it should be a emptyDir volume.

c) Map the ConfigMap we declared above as a volume for nginx container. Name the volume as `nginx-config-volume`, mount path should be /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and subPath should be nginx.conf

d) Nginx container should be named as nginx-container and it should use `nginx:latest` image. PhpFPM container should be named as `php-fpm-container` and it should use `php:7.1-fpm` image.

e) The shared volume shared-files should be mounted at /var/www/html location in both containers. Copy /opt/index.php from jump host to the nginx document root inside nginx container, once done you can access the app using App button on the top bar.

Before clicking on finish button always make sure to check if all pods are in running state.

You can use any labels as per your choice.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
