#### Deploy Node App on Kubernetes

The Nautilus development team has completed development of one of the node applications, which they are planning to deploy on a Kubernetes cluster. They recently had a meeting with the DevOps team to share their requirements. Based on that, the DevOps team has listed out the exact requirements to deploy the app. Find below more details:

Create a deployment using `gcr.io/kodekloud/centos-ssh-enabled:node` image, `replica` count must be `2`.

Create a service to expose this app, the service type must be `NodePort`, targetPort must be `8080` and nodePort should be `30012`.

Make sure all the pods are in `Running` state after the deployment.

You can check the application by clicking on `NodeApp` button on top bar.

`You can use any labels as per your choice.`

Note: The kubectl on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
