#### Docker Ports Mapping

The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to host an application on a nginx-based container. There are number of tickets already been created for similar tasks. One of the tickets has been assigned to set up a nginx container on `Application Server 3` in `Stratos Datacenter`. Please perform the task as per details mentioned below:



a. Pull `nginx:alpine-perl` docker image on `Application Server 3`.

b. Create a container named `ecommerce` using the image you pulled.

c. Map host `port 6400` to container port `80`. Please keep the container in running state.
