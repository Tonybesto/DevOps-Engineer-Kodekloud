#### Docker Ports Mapping

SSH to App server3 and as mentioned in task a, pull docker image `nginx:alpine-perl` using the following command,

`docker image pull nginx:alpine-perl`

Now create a container out of the image and assign it a friendly name as `ecommerce` and map port `6400` from host machine to container port `80`, use the following command,

`docker container run -d --name ecommerce -p 6400:80 nginx:alpine-perl`

Now, you can validate by requesting to nginx server over the host port 8085, using the following command,

[banner@stapp03 ~]$ curl localhost:6400
```

As well as we have run a container in deamon mode so it will be in a running state. Validate using the command, 

   [banner@stapp03 ~]$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                  NAMES

Thank you.
