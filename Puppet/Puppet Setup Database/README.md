#### Puppet Setup Database

The Nautilus DevOps team had a meeting with development team last week to discuss about some new requirements for an application deployment. Team is working on to setup a `mariadb` database server on `Nautilus DB Server` in Stratos Datacenter. They want to setup the same using Puppet. Below you can find more details about the requirements:


Create a puppet programming file blog.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on puppet master node i.e on `Jump Server`. Define a class `mysql_database` in puppet programming code and perform below mentioned tasks:

Install package `mariadb-server` (whichever version is available by default in yum repo) on puppet agent node i.e on `DB Server` also start its service.

Create a database `kodekloud_db2` , a database user `kodekloud_gem and set 
password `ksH85UJjhb` for this new user also remember host should be 
`localhost`. Finally grant full permissions to this newly created user on newly created database.

Make sure to create single puppet programming file demo.pp to do these all tasks.
