#### Setup Puppet Certs Autosign

1. First, check if there is any hosts certificate available on puppet master node, 

```
root@jump_host /# puppetserver ca list --all
No certificates to list
```

2. We need to do autosign for each agent node. For that we need to create `autosign.conf` as below on puppet master node i.e. on jump_host,

```
root@jump_host /# 

vi /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/autosign.conf
```
*Note: Refer current directory for the same config file*

3. Then, restart a puppet service using a command,

```
root@jump_host /# 

systemctl restart puppetserver
```

4. Now edit the hosts files on jump host as well as on all app servers and add an alias as puppet for jump host node,

```
root@jump_host /# 
vi /etc/hosts

172.16.238.1    jump_host.stratos.xfusioncorp.com puppet
172.16.238.2    jump_host.stratos.xfusioncorp.com puppet

As on App server you can do as below,

[root@stapp01 tony]# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
172.16.238.3    jump_host.stratos.xfusioncorp.com puppet
172.16.239.5    stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com stapp01
172.16.238.10   stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com stapp01

```

NOTE: If you do not add, you might failed while runnning/updating agent nodes with master node as they connect using the hostname.

5. Now on all app server, run agent test using a command,

```
[root@stapp01 tony]# puppet agent -tv
```

6. Finally, validate that the certificates are present for all nodes including master node,

```
root@jump_host /# puppetserver ca list --all

```

Thank you.
