## Linux User Expiry

A developer Kareem has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. Being a temporary resource for this project we need a temporary user for Kareem. Its a good idea to create a user with some auto expiry date so that user won't be able to access servers once expired.

So create a user named kareem on the App server 2. Set expiry date to 2021-03-28 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.
