#### NFS Troubleshooting

Nautilus production support team was trying to fix some issues with their storage server. Storage server has a shared directory /data which is mounted on all app servers at location /var/www/html so that whatever data they store on storage server under /data can be shared among all app servers. Now somehow NFS server is broken and having some issues.


Identify the root cause of issue and fix the same to make sure sharing works fine among all app servers and storage server.
