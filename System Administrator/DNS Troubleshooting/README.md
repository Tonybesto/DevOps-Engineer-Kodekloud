#### DNS Troubleshooting

System admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed some issues with DNS resolution in some apps intermittently. This time on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues. So we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.


As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS. Please make appropriate changes on this server.
