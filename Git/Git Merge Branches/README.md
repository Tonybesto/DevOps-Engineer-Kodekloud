#### Git Merge Branches

The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/news.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:



a. Create a new branch xfusion in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (on storage server itself). Add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch to the master branch. Finally, push the changes to origin for both of the branches.
