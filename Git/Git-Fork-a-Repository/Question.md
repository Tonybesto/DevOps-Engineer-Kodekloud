There is a Git server used by the Nautilus project teams. Recently a new developer `Jon` joined the team and needs to start working on a project. To do so, he needs to fork an existing Git repository. Below you can find more details:



Click on the `Gitea UI` button on the top bar. You should be able to access the `Gitea` page.

Login to `Gitea` server using username jon and password `Jon_pass123`.

There you will see a Git repository `sarah/story-blog`, `fork` it under `jon` user.
