####  Ansible Archive Module

The Nautilus DevOps team has some data on `jump host` in `Stratos DC` that they want to copy on all app servers in the same data center. However, they want to create an archive of data and copy it to the app servers. Additionally, there are some specific requirements for each server. Perform the task using Ansible playbook as per requirements mentioned below:



Create a `playbook.yml` under `/home/thor/ansible` on `jump host`, an `inventory` file is already placed under `/home/thor/ansible/` on Jump Server itself.

Create an archive `cluster.tar.gz` (make sure archive format is` tar.gz`) of `/usr/src/dba/` directory ( present on each app server ) and copy it to `/opt/dba/` directory on all app servers. The user and group `owner` of archive `cluster.tar.gz` should be `tony` for `App Server 1`, `steve` for `App Server 2` and `banner` for `App Server 3`.

Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.
