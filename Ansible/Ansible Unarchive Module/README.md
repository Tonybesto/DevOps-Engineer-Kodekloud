#### Ansible Unarchive Module

One of the DevOps team members has created a ZIP archive on `jump host` in `Stratos DC` that needs to be extracted and copied over to all app servers in `Stratos DC` itself. Because this is a routine task, the `Nautilus` DevOps team has suggested automating it. We can use Ansible since we have been using it for other automating tasks. Below you can find more details about the task:

We have an inventory file under `/home/thor/ansible` on `jump host`, which should have all the app servers added already.

There is a ZIP archive `/usr/src/data/xfusion.zip` on `jump host`.

Create a `playbook.yml` under `/home/thor/ansible/` on `jump host` itself to perform the following tasks.

Unzip `/usr/src/data/xfusion.zip` archive in `/opt/data/` location on all app servers.

Make sure the unzipped data must has the respective sudo user as their `user` and `group` owner, i.e tony for app server 1, steve for app server 2, banner for app server 3.

The extracted data permissions must be `0777`

Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.
