#### Managing Jinja2 Templates Using Ansible

One of the Nautilus DevOps team members is working to develop a role for `httpd` installation and configuration. Work is almost completed, however there is a requirement to add a jinja2 template for `index.html` file. Additionally, the relevant task needs to be added inside the role. The inventory file `~/ansible/inventory` is already present on `jump host` that can be used. Complete the task as per details mentioned below:


a. Update `~/ansible/playbook.yml` playbook to run the `httpd` role on `App Server 1`.

b. Create a jinja2 template `index.html.j2` under `/home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/` and add a line `This file was created using Ansible on <respective server> `(for example `This file was created using Ansible on stapp01 in case of App Server 1`). Also please make sure not to hard code the server name inside the template. Instead, use `inventory_hostname` variable to fetch the correct value.

c. Add a task inside `/home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/tasks/main.yml` to copy this template on `App Server 2` in `/var/www/html/index.html`. Also make sure that ``/var/www/html/index.html`` file permissions `0755`.

d. The user/group owner of `/var/www/html/index.html` file must be respective sudo user of server (for example `tony` in case of `stapp01`).

Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.
