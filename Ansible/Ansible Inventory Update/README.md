#### Ansible Inventory Update

The Nautilus DevOps team has started testing their Ansible playbooks on different servers within the stack. They have placed some playbooks under `/home/thor/playbook/` on `jump host` which they want to test. Some of these playbooks have already been tested on different servers, but now they want to test them on `app server 2` in `Stratos DC`. However, they first need to create an inventory file so that Ansible can connect to the respective app. Below are some requirements:

a. Create an ini type Ansible inventory file `/home/thor/playbook/inventory` on `jump host`.

b. Add `App Server 2` in this inventory along with required variables that are needed to make it work.

c. The inventory hostname of host should be the `server name` as per wiki, for example `stapp01` for `app server 1` in `Stratos DC`.

d. At the end `/home/thor/playbook/playbook.yml`, playbook should be able to run.

Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.
